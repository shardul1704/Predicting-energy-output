# Predicting-energy-output
Machine Learning project using Linear regression and multiple regression to predict net hourly electrical energy output (EP) using the Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set

Contributor - Shardul Nazirkar

Data Set source - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant

The dataset contains data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over
6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features
consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical
energy output (EP) of the plant.

Jupyter notebook is present in the Code directory and the data set is present in the Data directory.
